# one target app window through the SDK's window scope without taking the user's focus.
# Every `action`/`result` protocol event carries one of these (runner.py, and result.py's
# terminal_result() shape, which the supervisor's timeout/cancellation fallbacks build
# through); centralized so no call site can drift onto a stray literal.
